## Technologies Used

## Description
For this program, it will take the user to a splash page where you will find links to either view all your vendors or to add a vendor to your list.  If the user chooses to add a new vendor, the site will redirect to a new page with forms to enter in data and then submit the new vendor. The user can then continue to add more vendors or go back to either the splash page or the main list of all saved vendors.  If the user selects one of the Vendors, they can see all available data concerning that vendor as well as be able to go to a new page to add new Order information for that vendor similarly to the previous Vendor forms.
